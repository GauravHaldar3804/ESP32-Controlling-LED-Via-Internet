# ESP32 Web Server with Dynamic LED Control

Introduction

This project establishes a robust and versatile web server on your ESP32 microcontroller, empowering you to control an LED through an intuitive web interface accessible from any web browser on your local network. The server supports various LED operations, including:

Turning On/Off: Toggle the LED's state at will.
Alternating Blink: Set the LED to blink at a user-defined interval, seamlessly switching between on and off states.
Blinking the LEDs : Blinking all the LEDs at once
This project leverages the ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi capabilities and the powerful Arduino IDE for development. Its modular design promotes code reusability and maintainability.
